#Description
A Backbone.js and Require.js Boilerplate that promotes decoupling your JavaScript into modules, separating business logic from application logic using Models and Views, reusing your JavaScript between Desktop and Mobile Web versions, including non-AMD Compatible Third Party Scripts in your project, and optimizing all of your JavaScript (minify, concatenate, etc).

#Getting Started
   1. Clone this repository
   2. Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download) (this is used to run the Require.js Optimizer)
   3. Download, install, and start a local web server (eg. [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html)).  Make sure to put this repository in your local web server's public folder (eg. htdocs).

   **Note**: A local web server is required because Backbone-Require-Boilerplate dynamically pulls in an HTML dependency (a template), and IE and Chrome have local security restrictions that do not allow this action.  If you don't want to download and install a local web server, then you should be able to test the code locally with Firefox.  Keep in mind that if you remove the template, the code will work fine locally in all browsers.
   4. Enjoy using Backbone.js, Require.js, jQuery, Lodash, and Modernizr (enjoyment optional)
   5. Install Compass and start Compass Watch.
